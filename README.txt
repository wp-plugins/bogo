Bogo allows each user to choose their locale for the admin panel.

== Description ==

The Bogo plugin allows each WordPress blog user to choose their locale for the admin panel. This is a particularly useful feature when you manage a blog with authors who use different languages.

Bogo adds an extra drop-down menu for locales in each user Profile Settings page. You can choose from the options and switch your locale setting.

Note that you need language (.mo) files installed beforehand. See [Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_in_Your_Language) if you are not familiar with it.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `bogo` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
